     <p1>what is CSS?</p1>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheet</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,papeer, or in other media</li><br>
        <li><b style="font-size: larger;text-decoration: line-through;">Css is not necessary</b> <mark>CSS saves a lot of work</mark>.It can control the layout of multiple  web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>In the United States, there is a certain stigma behind both public and private schools. From the ones portrayed in movies and television, to the rumors of other<mark>schools that circulate through school systems, most can be written off as not true.</mark> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The same applies to private and government-run schools in India, where private schools are pulling away as the most common form of schooling. This bodes the question: Which is better?</p>
    <p>The first topic to cover is foreign language. Obviously, students are taught in local languages, usually also offering Hindi,</p>
    <p>Next up are uniforms. While uniforms are required in all schools in India, private schools go above and beyond. They check up on studentâ€™s hygiene, uniforms, and generalcleanliness to make sure they are up to par, showing not only discipline in learning but also in other aspects.  </p>
